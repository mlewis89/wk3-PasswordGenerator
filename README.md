# Bootcamp Challenge Week Two - Accessabilty

## Description

Purpose: to test my knowledge of HTML, and CSS formating.

in this project i was given no starter code, and a refference gif file of the expected output. The example included a navigation bar, hero image, and some content sections. including hover effect and css transitions.

During the project I learnt that if you want to make an image transparent but leave the floating text on top alone the text needs to be included in the same anchor ```<a>``` tag and should come after the ```<img>``` tag.

I also learnt how finicky it can be to get a specify style with CSS however the dev tools whithin chrome make it far easier to understand the root cause.

For the images within the site i have used a mixture of screen shoots from my previous assignments and my own photos.


# User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
